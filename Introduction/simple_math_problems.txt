#Math problems to solve

1 + 1 = ?

3 * 5 = ?

123 + 123 = ?

123 * 123 = ?

45 / 5 = ?


3 / 2 = ?   #why?

3.0 / 2.0 = ?

5^2 = ?  #5 ** 2

sqrt(5) = ? 


sqrt(5) * sqrt(5) = 5?  #computers only deal in powers of 2, they can get really close, but decimals are often not exact. Also need to approximate sqrt(5), not a nice even number.
