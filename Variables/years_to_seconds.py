#starter code for finding the number of seconds in any number of years

print("I can calculate the number of seconds in any number of years.")
years_string = input("Enter number of years: ")
num_years = int(years_string)

#TODO: finish the code using *=


print("There are {} seconds in {} years".format(num_seconds, num_years))

#Uncomment the line below to see another way to output a mixture of words and numbers
#print("There are " + str(num_seconds) + " seconds in " + str(num_years) + " years")
