You can copy and paste this code.

First install pygame (https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted).

Scroll down until you find the appropriate instructions for your
Operating System.

Let me know if you have problems. After install you should be able to run
python3 -m pygame.examples.aliens
in a terminal and see a space invaders game popup.


Mac: Might need to install some extra software

ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/
install/master/install)"

brew install sdl sdl_image sdl_mixer sdl_ttf portmidi

Ubuntu 16.04 (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42707566/how-to-install-pygame-for-python3-5-in-ubuntu16-04)

starter_code.py

moving_circle.py

Google pygame clock.tick() to see what it does.

Play around with x_step and y_step and the argument to clock.tick() to see
what happens.

Try to get the ball to bounce off of the walls.
Hint: You need to check if the ball has gone off of the screen and then
have the ball start moving in the other direction.

If you've spent more than 20 minutes trying to get this to work, then
move on to the next task to see my solution.


-------------
bouncing_circle.py

Run this program and see what happens.

Go through the code and make sure you understand how the ball "bounces" off
of the walls.

What happens if you start the circle at position (50,50)?
What causes this behavior? Try slowing down the simulation and using print()
statements to see what is happening.

Add another circle and start it at a different position and make it bounce
off the walls. Can you use a list and a for loop and a function to avoid copying and pasting
the code that updates the circles.

Now check for collisions between the two circles and have them bounce off
of each other too.


------------
falling_circles.py

copy the code and run it to see what happens.

Read though each line of code and try to understand what is happening

Change values to see what affect they have on the code.

Find all the TODO's in the code and complete them.

--------------
driving_circle.py

copy the code and run it to see what happens.
Try pressing the left arrow key...
