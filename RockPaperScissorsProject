Step 1: Rock paper scissors, play one round against random computer opponent
Step 2: Make it so you play 6 times in a row and output the score: +1 for each win 0 for each tie, -1 for each loss
Step 3: Make the game repeatable: after showing score ask if they want to play again
Step 4: Add a difficulty setting at beginning: 
	Easy (computer always plays Rock). 
	Medium ( computer alternates between Rock and Paper).
	Hard (computer plays randomly)
	Insane (computer always wins)
