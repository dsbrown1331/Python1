string = "Slice"
#you can reference an element with an index
print(string[0])
#you can also get a range of values, called "slicing" in python
print(string[0:3])

#TODO: print the last character of "Slice"
#TODO: print the "lice" portion of Slice
#TODO: Try index slicing for the following lists
shopping = ["eggs", "spam", "bread", "milk"]

#TODO: Read up on advanced slicing (https://www.pythoncentral.io/how-to-slice-listsarrays-and-tuples-in-python/)
